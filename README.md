# Exploratory Analysis and Forecasting of Fire/Emergency Incidents in New York City (2009–2017)
This project presents an exploratory analysis and time series modelling of the Fire Department of New York City (FDNY) incident data between July 2009 and June 2017.
The goal was to understand the evolution of fire and emergency incidents in New York City and to forecast future occurrences using time series modelling techniques, primarily SARIMA and Bagged ETS models.
The analysis was developed in R Studio.
